# Description

This path tracer represents the follow-up to the [earlier version](https://github.com/rajkdarbar/PathTracing-in-Unity), allowing for the rendering of triangular meshes, such as 3D models, in Unity. It also features diffuse global illumination, glossy reflections, and soft shadows for enhanced visual quality. Like before, special thanks to [David Kuri](https://twitter.com/davidjkuri) for his [excellent blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20230926225937/http://three-eyed-games.com/2019/03/18/gpu-path-tracing-in-unity-part-3/) and [code](https://bitbucket.org/Daerst/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity/src/Tutorial_Pt3/) contributions.

Don't forget to take a look at this [demo video](https://youtu.be/tOEfEWq_kg4) running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU.
